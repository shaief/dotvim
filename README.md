# dotvim
My dotvim configuration, always a work in progress.
This configuration is based on the work of [Meir Kriheli](https://github.com/MeirKriheli)  and [Oz Nahum](https://github.com/oz123). Thanks a lot for the information and inspiration :)


What to do with it, in Meir's words:
The following commands will clone the repo, symlink `~/.vimrc` and update the
bundles::

    git clone https://github.com/shaief/dotvim.git ~/.vim
    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    cd ~/.vim
    git clone https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim

Vim extensions:
* Vundle
* vim-fugitive
* vim-gitgutter
* vim-easymotion
* vim-colors-solarized
* vim-autoclose
* rainbow_paretheses
* vim-move
* nerdtree
* tagbar
